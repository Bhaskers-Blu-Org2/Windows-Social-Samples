# Windows-Social-Samples

This repo contains the samples which demonstrate API usage of the Social Platform available on the Universal Windows Platform. Primarily, the samples intend to demonstrate Contacts integration, integration with the Annotation system, and Social Feeds integration.

## Universal Windows Platform development

These samples require Visual Studio 2015 and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10 to build, test, and deploy your Universal Windows apps.

## Using the samples

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio 2015.

**Notes:**
 
   * Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select Properties, and then select Unblock.
   * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples. The samples all depend on the SharedContent folder in the archive.   
   * In Visual Studio 2015, the platform target defaults to ARM, so be sure to change that to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device. 

For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows 10 documentation available in the [Windows Developer Center](https://dev.windows.com). These samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows.

## Contributions

These samples are direct from the feature teams and we welcome your input on issues and suggestions for new samples.  At this time we are not accepting new samples from the public, but check back here as we evolve our contribution model.
